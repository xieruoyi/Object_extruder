1.Research related problems in computational geometry for robust solutions.

2.Develop routine to construct the surfaces of a single closed object given a set of top and bottom
surfaces, which may contain holes.

3.Generalize the previous step to handle large collections of surfaces that represent multiple closedobjects.

4.Develop functionality and a data structure that detects objects in contact and records the shared
surface.

5.Apply a 2D meshing library, such as Gmsh, to the resulting objects and surfaces.
